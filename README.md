# EventCommonSenseKnowledge_dissertation
All event relational (common-sense) knowledge extracted by previous papers (also in Ph.D. dissertation). This knowledge includes subevent, temporal, and causal relations between events. If you find it is useful, please cite my previous papers. Thanks!

1. regular_event_pairs.txt: temporal before/after relational knowledge between events. Please refer to "A Weakly Supervised Approach to Train Temporal Relation Classifiers and Acquire Regular Event Pairs Simultaneously" for more details.

3. subevent_pairs/ and temporal_causal_pairs/: subevent (parent-child), temporal (before/after), and causal relational knowledge between events. They are extracted using the weakly-supervised approach introduced by "Weakly Supervised Subevent Knowledge Acquisition".
